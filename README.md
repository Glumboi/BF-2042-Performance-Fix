# BF-2042-Performance-Fix
 A little program I made that launches bf 2042 and puts some processes on a higher priority to improve the performance a little bit. Don't expect a huge boost! 

# What it does
 - Goes into your documents and tweaks your save file to lower hidden settings
 - Creates a User.cfg file that is optimised to your processor to improve thread managing in the game
 - Launches the game via registry
